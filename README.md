The data folder contains a ratings.csv file. The file has the following columns:
Const,Your Rating,Date Rated,Title,URL,Title Type,IMDb Rating,Runtime (mins),Year,Genres,Num Votes,Release Date,Directors

1) Create a Class with the above listed properties. 
  - The required fields should be listed static.

  - There should be a function to update Your Rating.
  - Updating Your Rating should also update Date Rated internally.

2) Programatically read the CSV file
3) Iterate through the contents of the CSV file and for each row
4) Create a new instance of above class.
